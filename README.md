Hi ! This project aims at reproducing the behavior of a pyramidal cell in NEURON (simulation environement), BrainscaleS 2 (BSS 2 : Neuromorphic platform) and as an intermediary step (PyNN with Neuron). See the report for more information. To use it you need to install the neuron and pynn library and be able to access the Cluster at HeidelBerg (BrainscalseS2).

The PyNN-BrainscaleS directory is a copy of https://github.com/electronicvisions/pynn-brainscales some programs are modified in it ! 

The NEURON model is available here : https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/showmodel.cshtml?model=3817#tabs-1

PYNN_pyramidal/cell_type_demonstration.py comes from http://neuralensemble.org/docs/PyNN/index.html from Andrew Davison
Special Thanks to Andrew Davison who supervized me during this project and to the team in HeidelBerg !
